              A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. This is true both literally 
              and metaphorically for the founder of the company &apos;The Divine Hands&apos;. Akansha 
              started with her travel diaries in the year 2011 and has had the fortune of not just 
              visiting but living and experiencing at length the culture and ethos of various 
              geographies including UAE, US and UK. Experience being the biggest teacher, she learned 
              a plethora of things during this venture of hers and this learning prompted her to 
              embark on another venture of hers.

              Homemade and healthier food products are the most coveted both in/outside India but 
              due to the extreme rarity of such options, people don&apos;t have access to this variety. 
              Driven by her love for food and her supply-demand deficit comprehension, Akansha decided 
              to bridge this gap through her platform. This platform celebrates home chefs, their 
              creativity and culture. Akansha being a strong believer of the fact that &apos;Food is the 
              ultimate love language&apos;- she is starting with serving India but wants to export the 
              flavours and nostalgia of homemade food products to other countries as well.

              She has taken the first step and is already looking forward to the journey that God 
              willing, will not just entail a thousand miles but will eventually be boundless 
              (Both literally and metaphorically!ðŸ˜Š)
